"""Build setup

Setup the build environment for a C++ python extension module with `vcpkg` as
C++ package manager. It uses `scikit-build` to build the C++ extension module
and `GitPython` to pull `vcpkg` when it is defined as a submodule (as it is
recommended).

It is recommended to set the package metadata in the file `pyproject.toml`
minimizing the amount of package specific configuration in this file.

Raises:
    RuntimeError: If `vcpkg` is not a submodule of the repository.
