# Python C++ extension
A template for a standalone C++ library with dependencies managed by
[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) accessible through Python using
[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## Why should I use this template?
- You want to write a C++ library that can be accessed through Python.
- You want to use `cmake` to build your C++ code.
- You want to use `pybind11` to expose your C++ library as a Python module.
- You want to use some C++ dependencies and manage them with `vcpkg`. Otherwise
  you should check other [scikit-build sample
  projects](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects).
- You are not specially concerned about build and install optimizations, it is
  not a problem if they are long running.

If you want to distribute your extension using `pip` or `conda` and you mind
that your users take a long time to install it, then it might be better to
build some binaries instead of optimizing the build process. This template
might still be useful for you as it has workflows for building python wheels
with
[cuibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).


## Example usage

### Create a clean Python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate it on Windows
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
otherwise
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### Install this project
```
pip install git+https://github.com/esdandreu/python-extension-cpp
```
It will take a while to build as it will build the C++ dependencies as well,
but it will work. It is definitely not the most optimal way of installing a
package as we are installing as well the `vcpkg` package manager and building
from source dependencies that might as well be installed on the system. But
this allows a fast development environment where adding or removing C++
dependencies should be easy.

### Test that the C++ code is working in the Python package
Our simple project contains a `add` function that adds two numbers together.
```
python -c "import pyproject; print(pyproject.add(1, 2))"
```

It also makes use of the C++ library
[fftw3](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3.git) that is available through `vcpkg`
in order to perform a Fast Fourier Transform over a generated signal, printing
its results.
```
python -c "import pyproject; pyproject.hello_fft()"
```

## Setup
### Install the requirements
Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) requirements with the
addition of `cmake` and Python. It could be summarized as:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Build tools ([Visual
  Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)
  on Windows or `gcc` on Linux for example)
- [cmake](#cmake)
- Python. Make sure to have development tools installed (`python3.X-dev` on
  Linux, being `X` your version of Python).

If running on a clean linux environment (like a container or Windows Subsystem
for Linux) you will need to install some additional tools as it is stated in
`vcpkg`.
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl zip unzip tar pkg-config libssl-dev python3-dev
```
#### CMake
Follow the [official instructions](https://cmake.org/install/).

The required `cmake` version is quite high, if you are using a Linux
distribution and installing `cmake` from the repositories take into account
that they might not be updated to the latest version. However there are options
to [install the latest version of `cmake` from the command
line](https://askubuntu.com/a/865294).

Make sure that when you run `cmake --version` the output is `3.21` or higher.
The reason for this is that we are using some of the `3.21` features to install
runtime dependencies (managed with `vcpkg`) together with our project so they
are available to Python when using its API.

### Clone this repository with `vcpkg`

Cone this repository with `vcpkg` as a submodule and navigate into it.
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:esdandreu/python-extension-cpp.git
cd python-extension-cpp
```

Bootstrap `vcpkg` in Windows. Make sure you have [installed the
prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
```
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Or in Linux/MacOS. Make sure you have [installed developer
tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
```
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

## Building

### Build locally with CMake
Navigate to the root of the repository and create a build directory.
```
mkdir build
```

Configure `cmake` to use `vcpkg`.
```
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$pwd/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
```

Build the project.
```
cmake --build build
```
### Build locally with Python

It is recommended to use a [clean virtual
environment](#create-a-clean-python-virtual-environment).

`scikit-build` is required before running the installer, as it is the package
that takes care of the installation. The rest of dependencies will be installed
automatically.

```
pip install scikit-build
```

Install the repository. By adding `[test]` to our install command we can
install additionally the test dependencies.
```
pip install .[test]
```


## Testing

### Test the C++ library with Google Test

```
ctest --test-dir build
```

### Test the python extension

```
pytest tests
```
